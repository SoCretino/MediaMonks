## MediaMonks - Frontend Exam

Rebuild of the old MediaMonks flash site using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

##### Few Notes

* Skipped load-screen animation because it would be a waste of resources
* Used SASS CSS Pre-processor and Pug HTML Template Engine
* Used Font-Awesome social-media icons and chevron arrows because of the lack of these on the .zip file

##### Installation

Just cloning of the repo will do, but you can also run `npm install` for dev-dependencies.
